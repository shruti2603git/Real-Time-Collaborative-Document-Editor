The real-time collaborative editor allows multiple users to edit the same document at the same time. It was built using "Node.js and Express" for the backend, and "Socket.IO" allows communication between users. When one user makes changes, the server immediately sends those updates to all other users(to different open tabs) so everyone sees the edits in real time. The backend also uses "MongoDB" to store documents, so users can save their work and open it later. "CORS" allows safe communication between the frontend and backend, and "dotenv" is used to manage important settings like the database link. This project shows how real-time programming works and how multiple users can collaborate on the same document simultaneously. Finally, the app was uploaded to GitHub using Git commands.I have also shared the output of my project below to give the idea of how the project work like.
